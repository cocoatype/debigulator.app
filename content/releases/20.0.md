Debigulator makes your photos lower-quality.

â€¦

Wait, that's a bad sales pitch.

Debigulator shrinks and compresses your images to make sending images over the Internet significantly faster. My parents live in the absolute middle of nowhere and I made this app because I got sick of hearing "it's still downloading" when I sent them photos of my cats. If you're sick of hearing that, too, download this app.

It even works directly in the Messages app to make sending compressed images a one-tap experience.
