So, it turns out people actually used this app. That was unexpected.

And it turned out that it wasn't actually as straightforward as I imagined it to be. That was slightly more expected.

So I just kindaâ€¦ redid everything. Have fun?

New features include:
- Bigger images in the image selection screen
- Fixed a crash that could occur if you picked an older image stored in iCloud
- Displays the amount by which the image was shrunk in the preview view
- One-tap access to saving a new copy of the shrunken image
- Press-and-hold to compare between the high-res and compressed version of the images
