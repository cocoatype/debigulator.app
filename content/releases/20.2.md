Support for the new "limited photo library" feature of iOS 14; if you choose to limit Debigulator's access to photos, you can still select a photo manually by tapping the + button from the library screen. I'll work on improving this UI soon, but wanted to get out something sooner in case you wanted to take advantage of the latest privacy features.

Oh, also Shortcuts support, in case you want to automate your image-shrinking activities.
